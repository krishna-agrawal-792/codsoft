NUMBER GAME EXPLANATION
Initialization: We initialize a Scanner for user input and a Random object to generate random numbers within the specified range.

Game Loop: The outer while loop allows the user to play multiple rounds. It continues until the user chooses not to play again.

Random Number Generation: For each round, a new random number (randomNumber) within the specified range (minRange to maxRange) is generated.

Guessing Loop: Inside each round, the program enters a loop to handle the user's guesses. It continues until the user guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts (maxAttempts).

Feedback: After each guess, the program provides feedback to the user (whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct).

End of Round: If the user guesses the correct number, their score increments by 1. If they exhaust their attempts without guessing correctly, the correct number is revealed.

Play Again: After each round, the program asks if the user wants to play again. If the response starts with "y" or "yes", another round begins; otherwise, the game ends.

Score Display: Once the user finishes playing, the total score (number of rounds won) is displayed.

This program encapsulates the entire game flow, handles user input and feedback, and provides a structured approach to managing multiple rounds and scoring.

GRADE CALCULATOR EXPLANATION
Initialization: We start by initializing a Scanner object to read user input and prompt the user to enter the number of subjects.

Input Marks: We create an array marks to store the marks obtained in each subject. We loop through each subject to input the marks, validate them (assuming marks are between 0 and 100), and calculate the totalMarks by summing up all the marks.

Calculate Average Percentage: We compute the averagePercentage by dividing totalMarks by the number of subjects (numSubjects). We cast totalMarks to double to ensure floating-point division for accuracy.

Grade Calculation: Based on the averagePercentage, we assign a grade using conditional statements:

'A' for 90% and above
'B' for 80% to 89%
'C' for 70% to 79%
'D' for 60% to 69%
'F' for below 60%
Display Results: Finally, we display the totalMarks, averagePercentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.

Validation: The program includes basic input validation for the number of subjects and individual marks to ensure they are within the specified range.

This program handles the basic functionality of calculating total marks, average percentage, and assigning grades based on the entered marks for each subject. Adjustments can be made as needed, such as adding more complex grading criteria or additional validation checks

QUIZ APP EXPLANATION
Question Class: Represents a quiz question with attributes questionText, options (list of multiple-choice options), and correctOptionIndex (index of the correct option in the options list).

Initialization: initializeQuestions() method initializes the list of quiz questions. Each question is created with its text, options, and the index of the correct answer.

Quiz Flow:

startQuiz() method iterates through each question in the questions list and presents it using presentQuestion() method.
presentQuestion() method displays the question and options, starts a timer for 10 seconds using TimerTask, prompts the user for an answer, and evaluates the answer after the user inputs or when time runs out.
Timer Handling:

A TimerTask is used to handle the timer for each question. It prints "Time's up!" and moves to the next question if the user does not submit an answer within 10 seconds.
Answer Submission and Evaluation:

askForAnswer() method evaluates the user's answer based on userOptionIndex and updates the score accordingly.
User Interface:

Users are prompted to input their choice (A, B, C, or D) for each question.
After all questions are answered or time runs out for each, the displayResult() method is called to show the final score and summary of correct/incorrect answers.
This Java program provides a basic framework for a quiz application with multiple-choice questions, a timer for each question, and scoring based on correct answers

ATM INTERFACE EXPLANATION
BankAccount Class:

BankAccount class holds the balance attribute and methods deposit() and withdraw() to modify the balance based on user actions. It includes basic validation to ensure amounts are positive and sufficient balance exists for withdrawals.
ATM Class:

ATM class represents the user interface for the ATM. It connects with a BankAccount instance and allows users to check their balance, deposit money, and withdraw money. The start() method displays a menu using displayMenu() and executes corresponding methods based on user input.
Methods like checkBalance(), deposit(), and withdraw() interact with the BankAccount instance to perform operations and provide feedback to the user.
Main Method:

In the main() method, a BankAccount instance is created with an initial balance. An ATM instance is then created with this BankAccount instance, and the ATM interface is started with atm.start().
Usage:
Compile and run the ATM class.
Follow the prompts in the console to check balance, deposit money, withdraw money, or exit.
The program handles user input and ensures that operations are performed correctly based on the current balance and provided amounts.
This setup provides a basic ATM simulation where users can interactively manage their account balance through a console interface.
